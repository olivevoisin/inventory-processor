# Inventory Management System Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for our inventory management system, which includes voice processing, invoice OCR, Google Sheets integration, and scheduled tasks.

## Test Structure

Our tests are organized into several categories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and modules in isolation
   - Located in `__tests__/unit/`
   - Test modules, utilities, middleware, and routes independently

2. **Integration Tests** - Test interactions between modules
   - Located in `__tests__/integration/`
   - Include API tests and workflow tests

3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete business processes
   - Located in `__tests__/integration/end-to-end/`
   - Verify full workflows from input to output

## Directory Structure
## Mock Strategy

We use comprehensive mocking to isolate components under test:

1. **External Services**
   - Google Sheets API: Mock database operations
   - Deepgram API: Mock transcription responses
   - Google Cloud Translation API: Mock translation results
   - Tesseract.js: Mock OCR text extraction

2. **Internal Dependencies**
   - File System: Mock file operations to avoid disk I/O
   - Configuration: Mock environment-specific settings
   - Database Access: Mock database operations

3. **Third-Party Libraries**
   - Express: Mock request/response objects
   - Multer: Mock file upload handling
   - Node-cron: Mock scheduled task execution

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual functions and methods in isolation. These tests verify that each unit of code performs its expected behavior when called with various inputs.

Examples:
- Testing error handling in utility functions
- Testing business logic in processing modules
- Testing middleware behavior with mock requests

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different units of code work together correctly. These tests focus on the interactions between modules and external dependencies.

Examples:
- Testing API endpoints with mock HTTP requests
- Testing workflows that involve multiple modules
- Testing database operations with mock data

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete business processes from start to finish. These tests simulate real-world usage scenarios.

Examples:
- Testing voice recognition and inventory update workflow
- Testing invoice processing and translation workflow

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Our CI pipeline:

1. Runs automatically on pushes to main/develop branches and pull requests
2. Installs dependencies and runs all tests
3. Generates code coverage reports
4. Stores reports as artifacts for later review

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Run a specific test file
npx jest path/to/test.js --verbose

```bash
npm test
bash
